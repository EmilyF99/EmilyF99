# 👋 Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub
  My name is Emily (She/Her). 
  I've just graduated from the University of Northampton and I'm currently looking for new opportunities. 
  
  The language I have the most experience with is Java, however I am looking to move to more C++ projects in the future.

  ## 💻 Currently Working On
  Currently I'm working on adding more detail to my GitHub so I can showcase my work now that University has finished.
